TODO: Create pomodoro timer

For the pomodoro buttons, There should be a pomoStatus
- Paused and Stopped
- Reset can be a standalone function

The paused status will stop the timer from continuing
The stopped button will stop and reset the timer and set the status to  stopped

In that case the paused and reset function can be standalone functions. where they only happen when the button is clicked... I'm not certain yet

As of right now the timer function is done.

I want to add the feature of user being able to type in the pomodoro duration. Making the app flexible for longer tasks
